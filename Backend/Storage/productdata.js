      "Under the ravishing light of an Alaskan sky, objects are spilling from the thawing tundra linking a Yup'ik village to its hunter-gatherer past. In the shifting sand dunes of a Scottish shoreline, impressively preserved hearths and homes of Neolithic farmers are uncovered. In a grandmother's disordered mind, memories surface of a long-ago mining accident and a 'mither who was kind'.In this luminous new essay collection, acclaimed author Kathleen Jamie visits archeological sites and mines her own memories - of her grandparents, of youthful travels - to explore what surfaces and what reconnects us to our past. As always she looks to the natural world for her markers and guides. Most movingly, she considers, as her father dies and her children leave home, the surfacing of an older, less tethered sense of herself.Surfacing offers a profound sense of time passing and an antidote to all that is instant, ephemeral, unrooted.",

      "'Brilliant' - Sunday TimesHow does a truly disastrous leader – a sociopath, a demagogue, a tyrant – come to power? How, and why, does a tyrant hold on to power? And what goes on in the hidden recesses of the tyrant's soul? For help in understanding our most urgent Contemporary dilemmas, William Shakespeare has no peer.As an ageing, tenacious Elizabeth I clung to power, a talented playwright probed the social and psychological roots and the twisted consequences of tyranny. What he discovered in his characters remains remarkably relevant today. With uncanny insight, he shone a spotlight on the infantile Psychology and unquenchable narcissistic appetites of demagogues and imagined how they might be stopped.In Tyrant, Stephen Greenblatt examines the themes of power and tyranny in some of Shakespeare’s most famous Plays -- from the dominating Figures of Richard III, Julius Caesar, Hamlet, Macbeth, and Coriolanus to the subtle tyranny found in Measure for Measure and The Winter's Tale.Tyrant is a highly relevant exploration of Shakespeare’s Work that sheds new light on the workings of power.",

With an emphasis on the philosophical aspects of science, including the epistemic features of modern synthetic biology, and also providing an updated view of the autopoiesis/cognition theory, the book gives an exhaustive treatment of the biophysical properties of vesicles, seen as the beginning of the 'road map' to the minimal cell - a road map which will develop into the question of whether and to what extent synthetic Biology will be capable of making minimal life in the laboratory. Fully illustrated, accessibly written, directly challenging the reader with provocative questions, offering suggestions for Research proposals, and including dialogues with Contemporary authors such as Humberto Maturana, Albert Eschenmoser and Harold Morowitz, this is an ideal resource for researchers and students across fields including bioengineering, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, Chemistry and chemical engineering.",

      'A project-based guide to the basics of deep learning. This concise, project-driven guide to deep learning takes Readers through a series of program-writing tasks that introduce them to the use of deep learning in such areas of Artificial Intelligence as computer vision, natural-language processing, and reinforcement learning. The author, a longtime Artificial Intelligence researcher specializing in natural-language processing, Covers feed-forward neural nets, convolutional neural nets, word embeddings, recurrent neural nets, sequence-to-sequence learning, deep reinforcement learning, unsupervised models, and other fundamental concepts and techniques. Students and practitioners learn the basics of deep learning by working through programs in Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework. "I find I learn computer Science material best by sitting down and writing programs," the author writes, and the book reflects this approach. Each chapter includes a Programming project, exercises, and references for further reading. An early chapter is devoted to Tensorflow and its interface with Python, the widely used Programming language. Familiarity with linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probability and Statistics is required, as is a rudimentary knowledge of Programming in Python. The book can be used in both undergraduate and graduate courses; practitioners will find it an essential reference.',

      "The first account of the role Britain played in Einstein's life-first by inspiring his teenage passion for physics, then by providing refuge from the Nazis In autumn 1933, Albert Einstein found himself living alone in an isolated holiday hut in rural England. There, he toiled peacefully at Mathematics while occasionally stepping out for walks or to play his violin. But how had Einstein come to abandon his Berlin home and go `\"on the run\"? In this lively account, Andrew Robinson tells the story of the world's greatest scientist and Britain for the first time, showing why Britain was the perfect refuge for Einstein from rumored assassination by Nazi agents. Young Einstein's passion for British physics, epitomized by Newton, had sparked his Scientific development around 1900. British astronomers had confirmed his General Theory of relativity, making him internationally famous in 1919. Welcomed by the British people, who helped him campaign against Nazi anti-Semitism, he even intended to become a British citizen. So why did Einstein then leave Britain, never to return to Europe?",
